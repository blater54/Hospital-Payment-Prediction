# Summary

Log Transformation created a big impact in this project. The model created an 97% training accuracy model with Linear Reegression and 99.6% training model with Random Forest. 

# Introduction
Prices are a big issue within the U.S. Health System. I wanted to focus on prices and predictions of prices as my focus is to become a Health Care Data Scientist. The data provided was from the United States Government. The goal of this project is to use data visualization to locate trends, data cleaning and machine learning algorithm. The algorithm I will use is Linear and Random Forest Regression to predict the prices and will see which model produced better results. 

# Data Cleaning
I noticed that there were no missing values compared to other data set. However, upon grahing the features, I noticed that
